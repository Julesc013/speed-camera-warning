# Speed Camera Warning

**An unobtrusive overlay that signals if you are driving on a road with speed cameras.**

## What is it?

*Speed Camera Warning* overlays a small coloured circle onto your screen which changes colour depending on which types of camera are present on the road you are driving on.
- **Green:** No camera certificates.
- **Amber:** Fixed cameras only.
- **Red:** Both fixed and mobile cameras.
- **Grey:** No internet/GPS signal.
- **Yellow:** Unsure of location.

When you turn onto a road with a mobile camera certificate, the application will audibly beep/alarm to let you know.

## Why should I use this?

Applications such as [Highway Radar](https://highwayradar.com/ "Highway Radar") and [Waze](https://www.waze.com/ "Waze") give accurate location based warnings for fixed speed and red light cameras while driving.
However, mobile speed camera zone warnings are not included in these systems.

*Speed Camera Warning* checks to see if the current street your are driving on has certificates for mobile cameras and lets you know audibly and via a small indicator icon.

This program is intended to be used in conjunction with apps such as [Highway Radar](https://highwayradar.com/ "Highway Radar").

## How to get started.

Install the application APK.
Open the app, and start the service.

The service will run as an overlay until it is stopped.

## System requirements.

Android 8.0 (API level 26)
